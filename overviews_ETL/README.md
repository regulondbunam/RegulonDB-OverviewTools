# Overviews ETL 

# Description
This program is in charge of extracting data from a given database, it also reads a JSON file to obtain variables, routes and information that will be necessary to store in a new data cube. This information is processed, new data is generated and implemented in a new JSON,
which will be in charge of containing all the data that the end user will be able to see.


# Motivation

It was decided to implement python due to its ease of use and its versatility when handling small, medium and large-scale data, thus making the etl process more effective and efficient.


# System requirements

Python 3.7 +
Pymongo Module

# Install 

N/A



# Quick start

[How the first task can be performed with the software, or, in the more extensive  documentation, a link to the quick start. Outlines how to quickly get started with the software using a basic yet practical example]



# Project website 

[Website where the software is described and allows users to obtain it as well as its documentation.]

# License

[Defines the set of rules and conditions for people who want to use the software.]

# Support contact information

[It should be clear where to go for support, for example a contact e-mail address]

# Software quality checklist

[This may describe the state of the code, providing the necessary guidance on which aspects could be improved]
